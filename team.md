Hi folks, I am Subhajit Das, but you can call me Jeet. This is the last semester of my MS CS degree, and I want to finish my degree strong. That is why I have taken this Software Engineer course, which will help me excel in my career. Even though I have worked as a software engineer in the past, I still feel like there is a lot to learn, and I hope I will be a little bit of an expert in software development at the end of this course. I also work on my side projects because I love to solve problems, and I would be happy to collaborate with any of you outside this course. I look forward to working with you all and building one of the most impressive projects in this class.
