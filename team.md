Goodday, everyone.
My name is Theerarun Tubnonghee. I go by “Steve”. I did my CS undergrad at University of Colorado at Boulder. I have experienced — but not proficient — some of React/JS, python, and such. I have my side jobs as a freelance designer and media production teamlead, so I am good — I think — with management stuff and UX/UI design. Recently, I work on this website project for the in-ear monitor company in Thailand. You guys can check it out www.arcciem.com or www.arcciem-custom.co . It is just in early stage so don’t be too harsh on me haha. Anyway, I am glad to be on the team and want to learn from you guys !

#### Subhajit Das
Hi folks, I am Subhajit Das, but you can call me Jeet. This is the last semester of my MS CS degree, and I want to finish my degree strong. That is why I have taken this Software Engineer course, which will help me excel in my career. Even though I have worked as a software engineer in the past, I still feel like there is a lot to learn, and I hope I will be a little bit of an expert in software development at the end of this course. I also work on my side projects because I love to solve problems, and I would be happy to collaborate with any of you outside this course. I look forward to working with you all and building one of the most impressive projects in this class.
