## CS673 FA2023 TEAM 6 Project

### ABOUT :
A student marketplace for all your needs. Students now struggle to adjust to a new city and have problems finding textbooks, furnishings, notes, etc. (Project name) is the solution to all the student problems. Students may offer their used furniture, textbooks, and other items, making it easier for new students to establish in a new location. The potential users would be the students in Boston, we plan to restrict the application to student email addresses. The primary technology stack that we will be implementing will be ReactJS for front-end development and Python (RestAPI) and Postgresql database for back-end development. 

### Local Set up
 - [Front-End](https://github.com/BUMETCS673/CS673F23TEAM6/blob/main/code/web-app/Readme.md)
 - [Back-End](https://github.com/BUMETCS673/CS673F23TEAM6/blob/main/code/server/README.md)

### Tech Stack :
Front-End : 
 - ReactJS
Back-End : 
 - Python 3.x
 - Django with Django-rest Framework : For Model and everything
 - [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) : CDN service -  Decided to use Cloudinary
 - [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) : Postgres database and hosting it

### CONTRIBUTION STANDARD:
Initially all the codes and changes are pushed to the main branch. Consequently, it delivered code crashes and faced synchronizations. 
In order to avoid this synchronization, we created two branches which are fe (frontend) and be (backend). All the changes made in the frontend part are pushed to the branch fe. All the changes and performance happening in the backend are updated and pushed to the branch be. This makes a very clear path for everyone to understand where the changes and updates are made. Teammates are not given access to push the changes or update directly to the main branch.  The modified codes will be reviewed before PR (pull request). 
Finally, the two branches fe and be will be reviewed and pushed to the main branch by the team leads. Here is a simple diagrammatic view of how this algorithm works.
