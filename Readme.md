### CONTRIBUTION STANDARD:


Intially all the codes and changes are pushed to the main branch. Consequently it delivered code crash and faced synchronizations. Inorder to avoid this synchronizations, we created two branches which is fe (frontend) and be (backend). All the changes made in frontend part are pushed to the branch fe and all the changes and performance happening in backend are updated and pushed to the branch be. This makes very clear path for everyone to understand where the changes and updates are made. Teammates are not given access to push the changes or update directly to the main branch.  The modified codes will be reviewed before PR (pull request). Finally, the two branches fe and be will be reviwed and pushed to the main branch by the team leads. Here is the simple diagramatic view of how this algorithm works.
